# hello-world
This is my first Github experience in which I plan to start my journey to learn coding.

I am a quality assurance professional and business student who is looking to enhance my capabilities, knowledge, and learning by starting to learn to code. I am interested in languages such as C#, Java, C++, Python, Javascript, SQL, Ruby, and any other language I can learn. The purpose of my learning is to eventually obtain the knowledge needed to begin creating my own websites, games, and applications to work towards making my dream of owning my own technology company a reality. This is but one step forward in that process.
